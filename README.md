My current Linux configs for the apps listed below.

- Hyprland
    - This includes:
      - Hyprland
      - Hyprlock
      - Hypridle
      - Hyprpaper (not really much of a config) 
- Nvim
    - Currently telescope gives an error, this seemes to be
      since I am using treesitter main branch instead of master
      as they are currently moving to main. Hopefully a future
      update fixes this as others have the same issue and it. 
      It seems to only affect the highlighting in the code preview.
- Waybar 
    - Might add a bluetooth module later down the line but unsure.
- Wofi 
- Alacritty
